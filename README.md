Project Overview This project is a fully functional live online Cake Bakery Website built using only frontend technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Despite being entirely frontend-based, it is designed to handle up to 50 orders per week effectively.

KEY FEATURES:

* Advanced Animations: I have incorporated new and exciting CSS and JavaScript animations to enhance the user experience.
* Frontend-Only Solution: Although I have the capability to develop full-stack solutions, this project demonstrates how to build an effective online Store site without a backend.
* Cake selection: I have designed a logic where user can select the weight of the cake and the decoration, where each cake decoration have a code for the reference. 
* Order Management: I integrated Google Sheets to handle the cake booking details, offering a straightforward and cost-effective solution for managing orders.

Why This Approach? 
This project showcases an innovative approach to online store by utilizing frontend technologies to their fullest potential. Itâ€™s a practical and affordable solution for a new online business, emphasizing problem-solving skills and creativity in a purely frontend environment.
